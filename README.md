# Time-Series-of-Indices-Using-Sentinel-2-and-GEE-Python-API
This project focuses on analyzing time-series of vegetation indices such as NDVI, EVI, and Moisture Stress Index (MSI) using Sentinel-2 imagery and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) Python API. The main goal is to extract and visualize these indices over time.
